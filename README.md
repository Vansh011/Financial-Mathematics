Financial derivatives, options, futures, forwards, swaps , The Black-Scholes-Merton model and volatility.
The project provides an in-depth understanding of financial derivatives and their applications
in modern financial markets. It covers a broad range of topics, including options, futures,
forwards, swaps, and other derivative instruments, as well as the underlying theories and
concepts behind them. I have begun by introducing the basics of derivatives and their role
in risk management and then dove into the mechanics and valuation of options and futures
contracts, discussing various pricing models. Furthermore, the report covers the application
of derivatives in real-world scenarios, such as trading strategies, exotic options, and credit
derivatives.
The aim is to explores topics such as the Black-Scholes-Merton model and volatility.
